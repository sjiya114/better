       <p>A mortgage calculator for home loans can show your true monthly housing costs before you commit to a home loan.</p>
       <p>Home shoppers balance a lot of numbers: home prices, loan sizes, down payments, interest rates, property tax rates, mortgage insurance premiums, and so on.</p>
       <p>A mortgage payment calculator shows how these variables come together to shape a home's monthly payment.</p>
       <p>These tools are invaluable for comparing loan scenarios — and Better makes it easy by doing the heavy lifting for you.</p>
       <p>With access to an extensive network of investors, Better essentially “shops the market” on your behalf to find competitive rates, saving you the time and stress of lender-hunting. In fact, The Wall Street Journal named Better the Best Lender for Affordability in 2024.</p>
